Distributed Tracing

Finding Execution Path and Order of execution of microservices is complex as they are running at different devices.

- For 1 request multiple microservices may get executed in connected order
- In case of complex design finding execution path(TRACE path) is difficult as they're running in different locations and multiple instances(isolated components)

Spring Cloud : Sleuth and Zipkin

- They are given by spring cloud used for distributed tracing.
- Sleuth : Creates TraceId and SpanId to find execution path details and store in temp memory.
- Zipkin Client : COllects data from Sleuth(Sampling) and send to UI(Zipkin Server)
- ZipKin Server : A central server that will display all details of execution path.

Trace ID - generated for execution flow from request to response 
Span ID - for individual microservice
Parent ID - previous ms span id is current ms parent id

STEPS to connect zipkin server:
Zipkin server download link(jar) : https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart.html
Zipkin run command : java -jar zipkin-server-2.23.19-exec.jar 
Zipkin URL : http://127.0.0.1:9411/zipkin
